# Super Card Battle
It's a card similar to Super Trunfo, where you get a random card with power-stats from 0 to 100 and you have to choose one to compare with enemy card, if your choosed option is bigger than the enemy you get +1 point, if its the same, the cards are renewed, and if it's smaller you lose.

There's some options inside the game, for example: Pick another card, get a random enemy powerstat and pick an enemy powerstat. Each one cost some coins, when you play for the first time you get 10 coins, and everytime that you reach 10 points you get +1 coin.

## Tech stack

Our backend is a free API that gives us all data, for free. [SuperHero API](https://superheroapi.com/index.html)

At frontend we've used Angular 6+, Angular Material.

Firebase to Host, Auth and Realtime Databse.

GitFlow to manage our new features, hotfixs and releases.

And Agile Methodologies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
